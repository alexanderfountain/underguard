          # About Us


          The Most Inspirational Business Story in America.


          Underguard Teleservices is an Impact Driven organization, opening its
          doors for business in 2017 with a Mission to change how call centers
          operate.


          See there are three challenges call centers commonly face:


          1. A Rising cost of Labor

          2. Employee Turnover

          3. Talent Acquisition


          **The Underguard Solution?** An idea that would be unique, even
          controversial in its approach to Call Center Management. It would
          manifest to the “Smart Sourcing” method of call center management. In
          partnering with Correctional Facilities and putting inmates in the
          driver seat toward rehabilitation and developing job skills. Through
          this unique way of managing a call center, Underguard devised a
          solution to all three of the call center problems while improving the
          lives of people and communities which they live in.
