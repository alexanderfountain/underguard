          # About Us


          The Most Inspirational Business Story in America.


          Underguard Teleservices first opened its doors in 2017, with its
          headquarters located about 1 hour north of Memphis, Tennessee.
          Underguard’s Founder Casey Hannah, started the company because he
          realized several areas of opportunity after serving 6 years as a Call
          Center Director at a boutique call center outsourcing Company. Those
          areas were in Cost, Employee Turnover and Talent Recruitment. He
          recognized the cost of doing business in America was rising. When he
          began as a Director, minimum wage in Minnesota was $7.25 and in 2019
          some parts of Minnesota are on their way to $15.00. As such the
          operational costs were on track to increase over 100%. This increase
          in cost had to be passed thru to the client and some clients had
          little choice but to take their business to the Philippines or
          Pakistan, as some did.  So he began to explore ways in solving this
          while maintaining the USA footprint the company was built upon.


          A second challenge was Employee Turnover. Casey created a one of a
          kind culture in the call center, he was responsible for routinely
          making breakfast for his staff, taking them out for pizza and buffalo
          wings on the weekends and having an employee designed attendance
          policy, empowering his staff to create policies which they greatly
          appreciated (under his guidance of course). Even with this unique
          culture, Casey noticed people would leave for higher paying jobs or
          jobs that became available closer to their homes. He began to think of
          how to address this.


          The third challenge Casey encountered was attracting the right people
          for the call center job. With around an 80% annual turnover rate
          (still below a national average), the talent pool in the community
          became more scarce after the site had been operational a few years. To
          attract employees the company had to increase it’s starting wages and
          perks to get employees to respond which had an overall effect on the
          companies profitability.


          **The Result?** An idea that would be unique, even controversial in
          its approach to Call Center Management. It would manifest to the
          “Smart Sourcing” approach where the company would partner with
          Correctional Facilities and put Inmates in the driver seat as part of
          a job development, skills program. The company would employ US
          citizens service a minimum sentence and Underguard bring in its
