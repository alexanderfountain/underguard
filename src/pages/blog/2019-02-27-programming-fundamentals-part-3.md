These are some of the most common operators in JavaScript:

* Assignment:`a = 26`
* Math: `-`, `+`, `*`, `/` like `c + 2`
* Compound Assignment: `-=`, `+=`, `*=`, `/=`. These combine assignment and math operators. `b += 26` is the same as `b = b + 26`
* Increment/Decrement:  `--` Decrement, `++` increment. Like `b++` is the same as `b = b + 1`.
* Object Property Access: `.` like `console.log()`
* Equality:  `==` loose equals, `===`strict equals, `!=`  loose not equals, `!==`strict not equals. 
* Comparison:  `<` less than,  `>` greater than, `<=` less than or loose equals, `>=` greater than or loose equals like `c >= 26`
* Logical: `&&` and, `||` or, like `b && c`or b and c.
