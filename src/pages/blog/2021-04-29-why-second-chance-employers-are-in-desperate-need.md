**In 1994** the Federal Crime Bill led to an explosion of seemingly small cases to be thrown into a blender of the “Tough on Crime “mantra.

**It did so in two ways:**

First, the 1994 crime bill gave the federal stamp of approval for states to pass even more tough-on-crime laws. By 1994, all states had passed at least one mandatory minimum law, but the 1994 crime bill encouraged even more punitive laws and harsher practices on the ground, including by prosecutors and police, to lock up more people and for longer periods of time.

Second, the 1994 law shaped many of the harshest supporting laws such as the Three Strike law. Facing a booming drug epidemic, and rising gang violence Bill Clinton signed the “Violent Crime Control Act and Law Enforcement Act” into law thus solidifying the cornerstone of mass incarceration. 

States and localities were incentivized through a massive infusion of federal funding to build more jails and prisons, and to pass so-called ‘truth-in-sentencing laws and other punitive measures that simultaneously increased the number and length of prison sentences while reducing the possibility of early release for those it incarcerated.

In 2015 Clinton spoke to an assembly and said “I signed a bill that made the problem worse, and I want to admit it” He pointed out the rising gang violence and drugs on the streets being the catalyst needing such harsh rules.  “The good news is we had the biggest drop in crime in history. The bad news is we had a lot of people who were locked up, who were minor actors, for way too long.”  Clinton said.

So, what happens now? How do we fix this? Well the simple answer is that we start the journey. We reach out to family and friends who have a loved one whom is incarcerated. Support them and help them heal themselves and understand the situation. 

Underguard Teleservices has positioned itself as an entity that will uplift and empower people whom the system has affected.

Being 2nd chance doesn’t mean just hiring felons. People have been doing that for years! Our Mission is to invest in people whom the system has failed. 

Our Prison system has proven that it values Punishment over Rehabilitation, so we want to free these people by providing them the support and tools to Rehabilitate themselves.

As of 2020, the USA leads the world in people who are currently incarcerated with over 700 out of every 100,000 behind bars. That is more than 100 people above 2nd place of El Salvador, the self-proclaimed murder capital of the world.

Please join us in helping to do some good in this world.
