At Underguard our team is always thinking of ways we can better serve our communities and people.

In March of 2020 Underguard officially launched a work from home division to provide formerly incarcerated citizens with call center career opportunities.

What a success this initiative has been. As of April 2021, Underguard has put to work over 50 formerly incarcerated citizens in work from home call center opportunities.

"Our team recognized that we have a Mission to serve formerly incarcerated citizens as much as we do currently incarcerated, so we made the investment to launch a work from home program to continue employment for people after a successful release," says Kyle Hannah, Underguard's CEO.

Underguard's next goal? Get to 100 staff working from home.

"I am confident we can get there before the end of 2021. Our pipeline is strong and more companies are shifting their focus to being socially responsible and purpose-driven. We are on a Mission to keep transforming lives and each person we employ is given that opportunity," says Mark Golder, Underguard's Director of Operations.

Stay tuned for more and thank you for reading.
