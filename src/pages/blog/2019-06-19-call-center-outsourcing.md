What is Call Center Outsourcing?

Call center outsourcing refers to the business strategy of partnering with an outside company to manage inbound and outbound customer contacts. The outsourced call center may reside internally, externally, or virtually depending on the needs of the parent company. The benefits of outsourcing include delegating the costly and time consuming efforts dedicated to sourcing talent, on-boarding, training and development, quality assurance, and workforce management, while creating the opportunity to focus your time on customer service strategy, insights, and the performance of your business.
